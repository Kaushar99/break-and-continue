Sets ensure that the elements are unique and allows operations for adding, removing, checking for membership of elements. sets are most useful in problem-solving scenarios where we need to remove duplicates, perform set operations, check membership efficiently, filtering unique elements.In problem solving scenarios such as finding common elements between multiple lists, identifying unique elements in a collection, or removing duplicates from the data, sets offers a concise and efficient solution due to their unique properties and built-in set operations."

        "1. Memory Efficiency: Arrays in Python are more memory-efficient compared to lists, especially when dealing with large amounts of numerical data. Arrays store data in a contiguous block of memory, whereas lists stores references to objects scattered throughout memory.\n",

        "Use Cases: Lists are commonly used when we have a collection of elements that need to be ordered and accessed by their positions. They are suitable for scenarios such as maintaining a sequence of items, storing data where the order matters, and performing operations like iteration and slicing.\n",
